# Annoying-web-app
First project that I'm doing alone to include in my portfolio.
The idea is making a simple web app but in this case, it will be an app where the user can't complete his tasks. 
With HTML, CSS and Javascript I'm going to use the DOM to manipulate different events and make it hard to 
use the app.
